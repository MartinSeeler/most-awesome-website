# The world's most awesome website

Some time ago, when all these fancy new TLD like `.rocks`, `.sex` and `.website` came across, I thought about how cool it would be to own the most awesome website in the world, or at least the domain [most-awesome.website](http://most-awesome.website). For my surprise, the domain was still available, so I bought it. But then I had no idea what to do with it. I had also no idea, how the most awesome website in the world could look like. But maybe you do? So here is what you can do...

## It's your turn

I decided to create this project, to let the open source community create the most awesome website in the world as collaborative project. Everything commited to this repository will be public at [most-awesome.website](http://most-awesome.website) via Github Pages and some DNS fanciness.

You can create Pull Requests and decide, what should be placed on the page. Feel free to add whatever you want, as long as it's not violent, pr0n, or against the law.
